## Communication Channels

### Slack

We will be using Slack as our primary means of communication outside of Github.

### awarenv.tech GSuite email

If you'd like, I can set you up with an @awarenv.tech email account.  This will allow us to scale
the organization's communications and grow them in an organized way.  Outside of this domain,
I don't think email should be used for communication between members for work tasks.

### Monday

[Monday](https://awarenv.monday.com) is where we will be keeping track of the work that needs to
be done and that we plan to do outside of Github issues.  I chose Monday because it is clean, looks
nice, and not overly complex.  It will also give us a place to separate real issues from backlog
work, architecture, and design.
