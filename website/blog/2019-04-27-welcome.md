Welcome to the Ecosystem!

<!--truncate-->

Ecosystem aims to provide a centralized repository of documentation for the AwarEnv initiative.
The AwarEnv initiative's mission is to "instill awareness about environmental sustainability."
A roadmap has yet to be laid out in terms of what we will be building.  The very basic idea is to
have a suite of applications to spread awareness of environmental problems, and then branch from
there.

We are a completely open source project (Everything will be licensed under MIT!) and actively
looking for contributors.  We are willing to work with developers, engineers, entrepreneurs, and
anyone else with an ounce of creativity in their bones. Open source shouldn't be daunting; it should
be an enjoyable experience where constructive critiscism is received and given generously and
graciously.  We aim to fulfill that promise.

Come join us as we become inevitable!
